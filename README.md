# Isometric snake

A snake-like mini-game as a first try to project a cartesian coordinate system to an isometric coordinate system.

This project was inspired by these awesome videos:
- [How Isometric Coordinates Work in 2D games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04oQ2jOUjkU)
- [Why Isometric? | Art, Code and Matrix Maths | A Devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZXlxtMbC0)

The used assets are from this asset pack:
- [Isometric Dungeon Tileset 2D](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/isometric-dungeon-tileset-2d/)
